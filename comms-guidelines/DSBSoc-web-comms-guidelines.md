## DSBS Website and Social Media Guidelines

last updated October 22, 2018

This document includes instructions and style/content guides for maintaining and disseminating content on the Deep-Sea Biology Society communication channels. This includes the DSBS website and twitter accounts, as well as other online tools such as the DSBS email listserv and the Deep Sea Slack community.

# Preparing Blog Posts for the DSBS website

There is no "ideal" length for a blog post - they can be short or long depending on the content and purpose of the post. For very long posts, it is generally a good idea to use images to break up the text. INDEEP emails posted to the DSBS website can generally be copy-pasted in their entirety (note that INDEEP emails often require significant re-formatting to make them readable for the website)

**Images** - please try to include images or logos within all posts on the DSBS site (this will give the site some color, and make our content more visually appealing). Make sure that images are not copyrighted. Creative Commons-licensed images are preferred! These can be easily obtained on Wikipedia, or by carrying out an advanced search on Flickr or Google (checking boxes for images that are free to reuse/share). Regardless, images should be high-resolution so that they don’t appear grainy on the website.

**Wordpress Categories** - each blog post should be assigned 1-3 categories (but usually no more than that). Categories are used to classify the content of blog posts - see below for ta list of categories on the DSBS website and what kind of posts they should be used for.

**Wordpress Tags** - Tags are attached to the bottom of each blog post to give more descrition about exact content in the posts. Think of them like descriptive keywords. For each post, try to come up with 5-10 keywords that describe what’s in the post. If you start typing in the tags box, Wordpress will suggest tags based on previously used words/phrases on the DSBSoc website. Often it is a good idea to geographic location as well (e.g. location of a course, conference, cruise, or study site), to help with Search Engine Optimization.

**INDEEP Posts** - For blog posts that are copy-pasted from the INDEEP mailing list, be sure to use the "INDEEP" category and tag. Any DOSI related posts should also be assigned the "DOSI" category and tag. This will help keep track of the website content that is being posted through community mailing lists.

# Social Media Sharing

All new blog posts on http://dsbs.org are automatically forwarded to Twitter (usually a few minutes after posting; this is accomplished via a recipe on IFTTT)

## Conference Social Media Guidelines

* One person should be put in charge of coordinating/collating social media efforts at major Deep-Sea Conferences (the triennial Deep-Sea Biology Symposia, INCISE Submarine Canyon meetings, International Symposia on Deep-Sea Corals)

* A unique, conference-specific hashtag should be decided on and advertised a few weeks to a few months before the event. Check Twitter first - sometimes these arise from community members who will be attending conferences. If there is no hashtag, invent one. Keep it short and descriptive - e.g. #14DSBS was used for the 14th Deep-Sea Biology Symposium in Aveiro, Portugal in September 2015 (short hashtags are preferred because of Twitter’s character limit)

* Conference Tweets should be collecting during (or immediately following) the conference. This can be done using a tool such as Twitter Moments (https://twitter.com/i/moments and click "Create New Moment") or Wakelet (https://wakelet.com/). 

* A wrap-up blog post should be generated from the conference - and will be a requirement for students receiving travel awards from the DSBS.
